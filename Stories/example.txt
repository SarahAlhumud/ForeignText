 IT was in the spring of the year 1894 that all London was
  interested, and the fashionable world dismayed, by the murder of the
  Honourable Ronald Adair under most unusual and inexplicable circumstances.
  The public has already learned those particulars of the crime which came out
  in the police investigation; but a good deal was suppressed upon that
  occasion, since the case for the prosecution was so overwhelmingly strong
  that it was not necessary to bring forward all the facts. Only now, at the
  end of nearly ten years, am I allowed to supply those missing links which
  make up the whole of that remarkable chain. The crime was of interest in
  itself, but that interest was as nothing to me compared to the inconceivable
  sequel, which afforded me the greatest shock and surprise of any event in my
  adventurous life. Even now, after this long interval, I find myself thrilling
  as I think of it, and feeling once more that sudden flood of joy, amazement,
  and incredulity which utterly submerged my mind. Let me say to that public
  which has shown some interest in those glimpses which I have occasionally
  given them of the thoughts and actions of a very remarkable man that they are
  not to blame me if I have not shared my knowledge with them, for I should
  have considered it my first duty to have done so had I not been barred by a
  positive prohibition from his own lips, which was only withdrawn upon the
  third of last month.
 It can be imagined that my close intimacy with Sherlock Holmes had
  interested me deeply in crime, and that after his disappearance I never
  failed to read with care the various problems which came before the public,
  and I even attempted more than once for my own private satisfaction to employ
  his methods in their solution, though with indifferent success. There was
  none, however, which appealed to me like this tragedy of Ronald Adair. As I
  read the evidence at the inquest, which led up to a verdict of wilful murder
  against some person or persons unknown, I realised more clearly than I had
  ever done the loss which the community had sustained by the death of Sherlock
  Holmes. There were points about this strange business which would, I was
  sure, have specially appealed to him, and the efforts of the police would
  have been supplemented, or more probably anticipated, by the trained
  observation and the alert mind of the first criminal agent in Europe. All day
  as I drove upon my round I turned over the case in my mind, and found no
  explanation which appeared to me to be adequate. At the risk of telling a
  twice-told tale I will recapitulate the facts as they were known to the
  public at the conclusion of the inquest.
 The Honourable Ronald Adair was the second son of the Earl of Maynooth, at
  that time Governor of one of the Australian Colonies. Adair's mother had
  returned from Australia to undergo the operation for cataract, and she, her
  son Ronald, and her daughter Hilda were living together at 427, Park Lane.
  The youth moved in the best society, had, so far as was known, no enemies,
  and no particular vices. He had been engaged to Miss Edith Woodley, of
  Carstairs, but the engagement had been broken off by mutual consent some
  months before, and there was no sign that it had left any very profound
  feeling behind it. For the rest the man's life moved in a narrow and
  conventional circle, for his habits were quiet and his nature unemotional.
  Yet it was upon this easy-going young aristocrat that death came in most
  strange and unexpected form between the hours of ten and eleven-twenty on the
  night of March 30, 1894.
 Ronald Adair was fond of cards, playing continually, but never for such
  stakes as would hurt him. He was a member of the Baldwin, the Cavendish, and
  the Bagatelle card clubs. It was shown that after dinner on the day of his
  death he had played a rubber of whist at the latter club. He had also played
  there in the afternoon. The evidence of those who had played with
  him—Mr. Murray, Sir John Hardy, and Colonel Moran—showed that the
  game was whist, and that there was a fairly equal fall of the cards. Adair
  might have lost £5, but not more. His fortune was a considerable one, and
  such a loss could not in any way affect him. He had played nearly every day
  at one club or other, but he was a cautious player, and usually rose a
  winner. It came out in evidence that in partnership with Colonel Moran he had
  actually won as much as £420 in a sitting some weeks before from Godfrey
  Milner and Lord Balmoral. So much for his recent history, as it came out at
  the inquest.
